#+TITLE: Minimal example on how to convert =python= code with =cython= to use it in C++ application
#+AUTHOR: Xavier Garrido

This repository provides a minimal working example to use =python= functions within a C++ code thanks
to =cython=. Python functions are defined in the =src/foo.pyx= file using pyrex syntax. The =cythonize=
binary does the job to convert the =.pyx= file into a header and source code files /i.e./ a =foo.h= and
=foo.cpp= files. The =main.cpp= file from =src= directory holds the C++ code and everything can be
compiled /via/ the =Makefile=.

* Installation & use

You have to =git= clone this repository to somewhere on your disk
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/xgarrido/cython-example.git
#+END_SRC

Then got to the =cython-example= directory and just type =$ make=. You should get a =foo= binary file that
you can run with =$ ./foo=
